            <h2>How it spreads</h2>
            <p class="maintext">This is a new virus, so we're still learning how it spreads and how long the virus can live on surfaces. The most likely transmission is thought to be via respiratory droplets (a cough or sneeze) from someone in relatively close proximity (roughly 6 feet). It may also be possible to contract the virus by touching an infected surface, then your own eyes, nose, or mouth. </p>
        </div>
        <div>  
            <h2>Incubation</h2>
            <p class="maintext">The incubation period is thought to be anywhere from 2 to 14 days, which is why many states have called for social distancing measures for at least two weeks.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p class="maintext">Not everyone exhibits the same symptoms, but in general, the most common things to watch for are fever, cough, and shortness of breath.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p class="maintext">We don't yet have a vaccine to protect against COVID-19. Be aware that older persons and those with underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for complications or even death from this virus. Prevention and social distancing are currently our best weapons.</p>
