            <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
            <p class="maintext">In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ ‘D’ for disease, and '19' for 2019. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. Others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can then spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.</p>

            <h2>Where and when did it start?</h2>
            <p class="maintext">The World Health Organization (WHO) was first alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhun, a city in the Chinese province of Hubei, on December 31, 2019. According to the first WHO situation report on the coronavirus disease, the cases of pneumonia had no known cause, and totaled 44 by January 3. China’s National Health Commission originally traced exposure to a seafood market in Wuhan, but later reports indicate that the market was unlikely to be the only source of the virus.5 By January 7, the exact strain—a new type of coronavirus—was identified, and initially named 2019-nCoV.</p>
